            <div class="box2"><p>Darkest Dungeon is a gothic roguelike RPG dungeon crawler about the psychological stresses of adventuring. You will lead a band of four heroes, dealing with a prodigious number of threats to their bodily health, and worse, a relentless assault on their mental fortitude!</p></div>

                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Combat in Darkest Dungeon blends traditional, turn-based role-playing game mechanics with some original quirks. Dungeons are explored on a 2D plane, and your party of up to four heroes is arranged in a line. Placement in the party determines which abilities are usable, while enemy placement affects which enemies you can hit with certain attacks.</p></div>

            <h1>Graphics and Sound</h1>
            <br>
            <p>If it seems that the graphics were designed with elegant minimalism in mind, the audio-visual spectrum is slanted heavily towards the “audio” side of the spectrum. The music is delightfully evocative, and the sound effects are top notch.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <br>
                <p>In its best moments, Darkest Dungeon makes me feel crazy and hopeless. There's something I can't say for most games: The times when I most felt that I had irrevocably fucked up were also the times when the game was at its strongest. Though some of Darkest Dungeon's more annoying design concessions detract from the overall experience, I'd be foolish not to recommend such a singular experience. There's always a strand of hope, however slender, to pull yourself out of the darkness, and it's worth fighting through it.</p></div>
