                <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Jump King is a two-button game where you use one button to control the jump and the other button to control the direction of the jump. If you want to move to the right, you tap the right button. If you want to move to the left, you tap the left button.
The gameplay in Jump King video game is very simple and easy to understand. All you need to do is to tap on the screen to jump and keep tapping to jump higher. You can also tap and hold to jump higher.

            <h1>Sound</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The whole aesthetic of Jump King is as thoroughly retro as its difficulty is, with a beautifully pared-down but still vibrant and evocative 16-bit art style and equally retro sound effects. There is minimal music, only the soft whooshing sound of your jumps and the harsh bitty noises of hitting something accompany your efforts.</p>

                <h1>Graphics</h1>
                <br>
                <p>The graphics are 3D and the game is in full color. The graphics are done very well and are very detailed. The colors are bright and the game is easy to play.
                    The graphics in Jump King are very basic and simple. The game has a very low polygon count which makes it a very low-end game.

                <h1>Mechanics</h1>
                <br>
                <p>This is a game that wants to hurt you, and it wants to hurt you often and instantly. The feeling of making a poorly timed jump and losing an hour of progress in seconds is heartbreaking. The feeling of memorizing a section that previously tested you for ages or successfully reaching a new region of the tower, though, is all too satisfying. </p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jump King is an excellent experience in soul-crushing difficulty and nightmarishly precise platforming. It's the type of game that won't be for many people, but for the small percent that craves this kind of experience, they won't be disappointed. The somewhat imprecise nature of your jumping often frustrated me and diluted the pure player skill needed to clear the game, but it still ends up being a solid test of your patience and platforming skills.
