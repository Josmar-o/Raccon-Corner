                <br>
                <p>Some tasks are more engaging than others; farming specifically became a grind when I had to water every plant individually, for example, though later upgrades rectified this. However, the minigames that come along with fishing or mining are subtly complex. They require more strategy than initial appearances would suggest, utilizing elements such as the weather to succeed in your catch.

            <h1>Sound</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The sound quality of Stardew Valley again seems to stretch beyond what one would expect to hear from a Super Nintendo-esque game. Sure, the same seasonal overworld themes will be heard often, but with a soundtrack boasting no fewer than 70 tracks, there’s always something new to hear. Many shops and townsfolk have their own themes as well as unique ones for specific times or events. The songs are all quite pleasant and fit the setting of the game.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Graphically Stardew Valley is a bright, vibrant place reminiscent of the all-time best Super Nintendo games. The sprite work is detailed and varied, and a lot of time and effort went into making each character’s sprite and character portrait unique.

                <h1>CO-OP</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Multiplayer is a fantastic addition to Stardew Valley that entirely changes how the game can be played. As expected, it helps you accomplish far more in a day if you have a cooperative farmhand, but does so without feeling too much like a cheat code. When a friend joins they get their own home (that the main player can enter and customize) and have to start a new character from scratch. This means they have low energy, weak starting tools, hardly any crafting recipes, and no skill perks.</p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Stardew Valley is a beautiful, fun game that, when all of its parts are pulled together, make for a wonderful countryside adventure. Whether it’s rainy, sunny, snowy, or dusted with pollen drifts through the air, each day offers an abundance of great activities ready to be collected or mastered and new friendships waiting to be made.
